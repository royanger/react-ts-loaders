# React Loaders

A react library that provides components for pure CSS loaders. The library has full TypeScript support.

[![NPM](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/react-ts-loaders.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-ts-loaders)

## Demo

You can view a demo with live configuration options at https://loaders.royanger.app/

## Install

```bash
npm install --save react-ts-loaders
```

## Usage

### No Configuration

This component is designed to (usually) work right out of the box without needing to set anything up.

```tsx
import * as React from 'react'
import Loader from 'react-ts-loaders'

const Example = () => {
   return <Loader />
}
```

### Simple Configuration

Passing in a loader type and a color is probably all most people will need or want.

```tsx
import * as React from 'react'
import Loader from 'react-ts-loaders'

const Example = () => {
   return <Loader type="spinner" color="blue" />
}
```

## Full Configuration

```tsx
import * as React from 'react'
import Loader from 'react-ts-loaders'

const Example = () => {
   return <Loader type="spinner" color="blue" altColor="lightblue" size={200} className="dark-loader />
}
```

## Context Configuration

Are you planning to use Loaders in many places and want to control their type, colors, size or classes from one location? You can easily use Context to create a base configuration.

```tsx
import * as React from 'react'
import { LoaderProvider } from '../src/lib/loaderContext'

ReactDOM.render(
   <React.StrictMode>
      <LoaderProvider
         value={{
            type: 'dualring',
            color: 'rgb(0, 128, 58)',
            altColor: 'rgb(241, 25, 213)',
            size: 100,
            className: 'dark-loader',
         }}
      >
         <App />
      </LoaderProvider>
```

The Context Configuration takes all of the same props as a single `<Loader>` component. The only **_required_** prop is `type`.

With the exception of `className`, the props you supply to the Context Configuration can be **_overridden_** on a specific instance of the `Loader` component. IE, you can set all Loaders to be a red, but if you do `<Loader color="rgb(0, 128, 58)" />` then that loader will be green. This gives you the flexibility to have one off loaders, while having a default configuration for your application.

As mentioned, `className` does behave a little differently. It will combine the classes given via Context with those given via the specific component instance. The resulting class list will include all classes.

You can access the Consumer via hooks if you need to. This is purely optional. The component handles consuming the context and applying the settings without anything required in your application. **_Note:_** If you do use this hook, be aware there is no check that your are using it inside of a Provider.

```jsx
import * as React from 'react'
import { useLoaderContext } from './loaderContext'

const context = useLoaderContext()
```

## Props

All props are optional. If you do not specify a type, then the `spinner` type will be used. If you don't specify any colors then the `currentColor` for the element will be used and the background will be transparent.

### `type`

Specify the type of loader you want to use. The current options are `spinner`, `ellipsis`, `dualring`, `hourglass`, `dotspinner`, `pulse`, `ring`, `roller`, `grid`, `ripple` and `circle`.

### `color`

The color to use for the loader. If no `altColor` is specified then `color` is used for all foreground elements and the loader will have one consistent color.

Valid ways to define your color:

-  `color="blue"` (any [HTML Color name](https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_names.asp))
-  `color="rgb(54, 3, 95)"`
-  `color="rgba(54, 3, 95,.3)"`
-  `color="hsl(147, 50%, 47%)"`
-  `color="hsla(147, 50%, 47%,.2)"`
-  `color="var(--brand-primary)"` (CSS variables defined in your application)

### `altColor`

This will define the secondary foreground color for the loader. This will make it into a duotone variation. The `altColor` can be defined the same way as `color` above.

### `size`

This number should represent a percent, just without the % sign. It will increase of decrease the size of the loader appropriately.

Examples:

-  `size={200}` - The loader will be 200% default size
-  `size={50}` - The loader will be 50% default size

### `className`

Pass any classes you want to the Loader. These will be applied to the outer most div so you can target styling.
